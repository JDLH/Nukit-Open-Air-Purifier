# Nukit-Open-Air-Purifier
Nukit Open Air Purifiers are an Open Hardware device for improving indoor air quality. They are designed to use with North American standard HVAC filters and PC fans. They are often an improvement over commercial air purifiers as they are quieter per m3 CADR delivered, have a lower cost of ownership per year, and are easily repairable.
