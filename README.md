**About**
---
Nukit Open Air Purifiers are Open Hardware devices for improving indoor air quality. They are designed to be used with North American standard HVAC filters and PC fans. They are often an improvement over commercial air purifiers as they are quieter per m3 CADR delivered, have a lower cost of ownership per year, and are easily repairable. 

**General Guidelines**
---
* Nukit Open Air Purifiers are designed to be made with any 3mm or 1/8th inch material that is safe to laser cut. Care should be taken not to use materials prone to off-gassing. 
* Regular yellow wood glue is sufficient, but polyurethane glue is somewhat stronger and significantly messier to work with. 
* Several coats of sealant will ensure a service life of many years and prevent any issues with mold or mildew (although this should be checked with a flashlight when the filters are changed and the enclosure disposed of in the unlikely event of any growth). 
* Every effort should be made to use low VOC materials and finishes and allow them to fully cure before deploying the air purifier.
* Nukit Open Air Purifiers all come without a wiring port as different users prefer them in different locations, and they are easy to add with Inkscape or any vector editing software.

The responsibility to safely deploy and use Nukit Open Air Purifiers lies entirely with the end user. Machinery Enchantress LLC offers no promises or warranties of any kind and is not liable for any mishaps that occur as a result of using these files.
